		<h2> JOANA M. BAGIOSO BSIS-3A </h2>
		<p> <em> My name is Joana M. Bagioso, and I am  20 years old. I lived in Barangay Inalad Calubian Leyte. I am the oldest of our siblings because my older brother died when I was little. Now I am in my third year of college, studying a Bachelor of Science in Information System at Biliran Province State University. I am an ambivert, a simple person, kind, humble, and passionate. I love watching the beauty of the sunrise and sunset, but I prefer sunsets more. I enjoy dancing TikTok as a way to relieve my boredom, although I'm not very good at it. I also like gazing at the moon at night, surrounded by many shining stars. Additionally, I enjoy traveling on road trips and visiting beaches with my family and friends. </em> </p>
